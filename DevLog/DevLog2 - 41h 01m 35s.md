# Devlog 2

Finally set up in "the office", kids and mom are out for two hours. Time to get things done. 

# Game Idea
See [PreJam Brainstorming](DevLog/PreJam%20Brainstorming.md) for some ideas that I had before (two hours, drunk) the jam√©

- My bathroom puzzle game That I want to do fooor so long...
	- The inevitable is that at some point you run out of combinaisons
	- Delay ? doesnt work that well.... 
- A reverse deck builder, where you have to reverse your mutation before you decay too much. 
	- Mutations help you a lot, by giving you special powers. They also increase your [[CORRUPTION]] level. 
	- The more [MUTATION](DevLog/CARDS/MUTATION%20cards.md) you remove the weaker you get. 
	- The more mutations you have the faster you die 
	- You get mutations every round 
	- You always die at the end
	- You want to die "human"
	- Could be multiplayer. or against AI.
	- There should be currencies ?
		- LIFE/TIME : How much life you have left before you die
		- UNMUTATION JUICE : Necessary to remove mutation ?
		- CORRUPTION : Increase by how many mutations you have
		- FOOD ? 
	- The Environment is changing :
		- There are [RESSOURCE cards](DevLog/CARDS/RESSOURCE%20cards.md) you can grab
		- There are [HAZARD cards](DevLog/CARDS/HAZARD%20cards.md) that affect you
